# MS Access to SQL Export Tool

**Easily export MS Access databases to SQL scripts!**

This project provides a Python-based utility to export the structure and data of MS Access databases (`.mdb`, `.accdb`) into an SQL script. The tool ensures the correct handling of table structures, primary keys, and foreign key relationships, allowing for a smooth migration to other SQL-based databases.

## Features

- **Table Structure Export**: Generate `CREATE TABLE` statements with correct data types and constraints.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Automatically extract and define primary and foreign key relationships.
- **Data Export**: Populate SQL scripts with table data, including support for reference tables (`Ref_*`).
- **Encoding Support**: Outputs scripts in UTF-8 for maximum compatibility.
- **Customizable DAO Integration**: Uses the `DAO.DBEngine.120` driver for precise MS Access database interactions.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Use the file dialog to select your MS Access database file (`.mdb`, `.accdb`).
3. The tool generates an SQL file (`export_msaccess.sql`) with the full database structure and data.
4. Review or modify the exported script as needed, then import it into your SQL database.

## Planned Features

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: 
  - User-friendly interface for non-technical users.
  - Interactive selection of tables and data to export.

- **Data Integrity Control**: 
  - Include checks and validation to ensure consistent and complete data exports.

- **Advanced Export Options**: 
  - Custom filters for rows and columns.
  - Selective inclusion or exclusion of relationships and constraints.

- **Enhanced SQL Compatibility**: 
  - Configurable output for different SQL dialects (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).

## Example SQL Output

The following is a sample SQL snippet generated by the tool:

```sql
-- Table: Ref_Countries
CREATE TABLE 'Ref_Countries' (
  'ID' Integer NOT NULL,
  'Name' Text(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

-- Filling data for Ref_Countries
INSERT INTO 'Ref_Countries' (ID, Name) VALUES
  (1, 'United States'),
  (2, 'Germany'),
  (3, 'France');
```
