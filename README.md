# MS Access to SQL Export Tool

**Easily export MS Access databases to SQL scripts!**

This project provides a Python-based utility to export the structure and data of MS Access databases (`.mdb`, `.accdb`) into an SQL script. The tool ensures the correct handling of table structures, primary keys, and foreign key relationships, allowing for a smooth migration to other SQL-based databases.

## Features

- **Table Structure Export**: Generate `CREATE TABLE` statements with correct data types and constraints.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Automatically extract and define primary and foreign key relationships.
- **Data Export**: Populate SQL scripts with export table data.
- **Substantive Treeview class**: With filtering block via Pandas DataFrame.
- **Quick render class**: Allows rendering of `tk` or `ttk` elements without explicit object definitions.
- **Customizable DAO Integration**: Uses the `DAO.DBEngine.120` driver for precise MS Access database interactions.

## Who Needs This Tool?

This tool is ideal for professionals who deal with MS Access databases and need to migrate, integrate, or back up their data in SQL format:

- **Data Engineers**: Simplify ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes by seamlessly incorporating MS Access databases into modern SQL-based systems. See [issue #16](https://github.com/whellcome/MSAccessToSQL/issues/16) for our plans to support command-line execution, making automation even easier.
  
- **Database Administrators**: Save time and effort when exporting complex MS Access databases while maintaining referential integrity. The planned feature for [saving and loading configurations](https://github.com/whellcome/MSAccessToSQL/issues/17) will make repetitive export tasks effortless.
  
- **Developers**: Work with legacy MS Access data using familiar SQL scripts for modern web and software development.

### Related Issues:

1. [x] **[Command-line Execution (#16)](https://github.com/whellcome/MSAccessToSQL/issues/16)** (In process)  
   - Automate the export process to support batch jobs and integration with enterprise ETL pipelines. Ideal for organizations heavily reliant on MS Access databases.

2. [x] **[Save and Load Configurations (#17)](https://github.com/whellcome/MSAccessToSQL/issues/17)** (Done) 
   - Add functionality to save the current export setup (e.g., database path, selected tables) and reload it in future sessions, enabling quick and consistent operations.

## Install

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/whellcome/MSAccessToSQL
   cd MSAccessToSQL
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Important

This project relies on the `tkextras` module, which enhances functionality for working with the `tkinter` interface. The `tkextras` module, along with other dependencies, is included in the `requirements.txt` file. 

**Note:** If the `tkextras` module does not install automatically, you can manually install it using the following command:


   ```bash
   pip install tkextras
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Use the file dialog to select your MS Access database file (`.mdb`, `.accdb`).
3. The tool generates an SQL file with the full database structure and data.
4. Review or modify the exported script as needed, then import it into your SQL database.

### **Command Line Usage Instructions**

The **MS Access to SQL Export Tool** supports both **graphical mode** and **command-line execution** for automated
exports.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Initial Setup (Graphical Mode)**

To configure your export settings, follow these steps:

1. **Run the script** without parameters to launch the graphical interface:
   ```sh
   python export-msaccess-sql.py
   ```
2. **Select an MS Access database** (`.mdb` or `.accdb`) and choose (check) the tables for:
    - **Table export** (Structure schema)
    - **Data export** (records)
3. **Save your configuration** to a file for future use.

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Automated Export (Command-Line Mode)**

Once a configuration file is created, the export process can be executed without user interaction.

- **Run the script with the `-c` or `--config` parameter** to specify the configuration file:
  ```sh
  python export-msaccess-sql.py -c my_config.json
  ```
 
- The script will **automatically load the configuration** and **execute the export**.
- The **execution log** is displayed in the console.

---

### **ðŸ“Œ Notes**

- Ensure the configuration file **is valid** and contains correct database paths.
- If the configuration includes **Table (structure schema) selections**, the export will process those and related tables.
- If running on Windows, you can create a **batch script (`.bat`)** for scheduled execution.

ðŸ’¡ This feature allows **data engineers** and **database administrators** to integrate the tool into **ETL pipelines**
and **automate migration processes**. ðŸš€


#### **Important Note: Access Permissions**

To ensure the application functions correctly, read access to the system tables (`MSysObjects` and `MSysRelationships`) in your Access database is required. Without this access, the application will not be able to extract necessary metadata.

**Steps to Grant Permissions:**

1. Open your Access database.
2. Run the following VBA script in the VBA editor (`Alt+F11`):
    ```vba
    Sub GrantPermissions()
        On Error Resume Next
        Dim strDdl As String
        strDdl = "GRANT SELECT ON MSysObjects TO Admin;"
        CurrentProject.Connection.Execute strDdl
        strDdl = "GRANT SELECT ON MSysRelationships TO Admin;"
        CurrentProject.Connection.Execute strDdl
        If Err.Number = 0 Then
            MsgBox "Permissions granted successfully.", vbInformation
        Else
            MsgBox "Failed to grant permissions. Error: " & Err.Description, vbCritical
        End If
    End Sub
    ```
3. Save the changes and re-run the application.

If you do not have access to modify permissions, please contact your database administrator.

## Planned Features

  - User-friendly interface for non-technical users.  
  - Interactive selection of tables and data to export.

- [x] **Data Integrity Control** *(Done)*:  
  - Include checks and validation to ensure consistent and complete data exports.

- [x] **Advanced Export Options** *(Done)*:  
  - Custom filters for rows and columns.  
  - Selective inclusion or exclusion of relationships and constraints.

## Example SQL Output

The following is a sample SQL snippet generated by the tool:

```sql
-- Table: Ref_Countries
CREATE TABLE 'Ref_Countries' (
  'ID' Integer NOT NULL,
  'Name' Text(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

-- Filling data for Ref_Countries
INSERT INTO 'Ref_Countries' (ID, Name) VALUES
  (1, 'United States'),
  (2, 'Germany'),
  (3, 'France');
```
