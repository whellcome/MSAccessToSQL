# MS Access to SQL Export Tool

**Easily export MS Access databases to SQL scripts!**

This project provides a Python-based utility to export the structure and data of MS Access databases (`.mdb`, `.accdb`) into an SQL script. The tool ensures the correct handling of table structures, primary keys, and foreign key relationships, allowing for a smooth migration to other SQL-based databases.

## Features

- **Table Structure Export**: Generate `CREATE TABLE` statements with correct data types and constraints.
- **Primary and Foreign Keys**: Automatically extract and define primary and foreign key relationships.
- **Data Export**: Populate SQL scripts with export table data.
- **Substantive Treeview class** With filtering block via Pandas DataFrame
- **Quick render class** Allows to render a tk or ttk elements without explicitly objects definitions
- **Customizable DAO Integration**: Uses the `DAO.DBEngine.120` driver for precise MS Access database interactions.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Use the file dialog to select your MS Access database file (`.mdb`, `.accdb`).
3. The tool generates an SQL file with the full database structure and data.
4. Review or modify the exported script as needed, then import it into your SQL database.

#### **Important Note: Access Permissions**

To ensure the application functions correctly, read access to the system tables (`MSysObjects` and `MSysRelationships`) in your Access database is required. Without this access, the application will not be able to extract necessary metadata.

**Steps to Grant Permissions:**

1. Open your Access database.
2. Run the following VBA script in the VBA editor (`Alt+F11`):
    ```vba
    Sub GrantPermissions()
        On Error Resume Next
        Dim strDdl As String
        strDdl = "GRANT SELECT ON MSysObjects TO Admin;"
        CurrentProject.Connection.Execute strDdl
        strDdl = "GRANT SELECT ON MSysRelationships TO Admin;"
        CurrentProject.Connection.Execute strDdl
        If Err.Number = 0 Then
            MsgBox "Permissions granted successfully.", vbInformation
        Else
            MsgBox "Failed to grant permissions. Error: " & Err.Description, vbCritical
        End If
    End Sub
    ```
3. Save the changes and re-run the application.

If you do not have access to modify permissions, please contact your database administrator.

## Planned Features

- [x] **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** *(Done)*:  
  - User-friendly interface for non-technical users.  
  - Interactive selection of tables and data to export.

- [x] **Data Integrity Control** *(Done)*:  
  - Include checks and validation to ensure consistent and complete data exports.

- [x] **Advanced Export Options** *(Done)*:  
  - Custom filters for rows and columns.  
  - Selective inclusion or exclusion of relationships and constraints.

## Example SQL Output

The following is a sample SQL snippet generated by the tool:

```sql
-- Table: Ref_Countries
CREATE TABLE 'Ref_Countries' (
  'ID' Integer NOT NULL,
  'Name' Text(255) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

-- Filling data for Ref_Countries
INSERT INTO 'Ref_Countries' (ID, Name) VALUES
  (1, 'United States'),
  (2, 'Germany'),
  (3, 'France');
```
